    pattern gains one variant per compression used by the files *that pattern*
    matches. Expanding an exact name as if it were a pattern would append a
    second suffix.

    Each FileSet is resolved against its own members, never against the batch:
    one handler describes every file of its format in the dataset, so a wrapper
    anywhere would otherwise reach a FileSet whose own directory holds none —
    claiming ``application/gzip`` and an include matching no file.

    Membership follows the files, not the glob text. An entry belongs to a
    FileSet when a pattern matches the name it is stored under, or when it
    duplicates an entry that belongs: a twin stored as ``pixel.jpeg.gz`` rides
    with the ``pixel.jpg`` it links to, and no glob the handler declares spells
