"""What an OME-TIFF's header says about itself.

OME-TIFF is the interchange format of light microscopy: what Bio-Formats
writes, what OMERO and the Image Data Resource serve, and what a microscope
exports when asked for something another lab can read. Its TIFF header carries
an OME-XML document in tag 270 saying what the image *is* — how many channels,
what the pixel spacing is in physical units, which axis order the planes are
in, what the pixel type is.

This module reads that document and nothing else. It builds no Croissant, opens
no file, and never touches pixel data.
