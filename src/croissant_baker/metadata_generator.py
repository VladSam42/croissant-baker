    Walks the assembled metadata dict and applies user-supplied per-column
    overrides keyed by field name. Used to link columns to external
    vocabularies (e.g. Wikidata, SNOMED, LOINC). mlcroissant 1.1.0 exposes
    no Python parameter for ``equivalent_property``, so we patch the
    serialised JSON-LD directly.

    Matching is by bare field name across the entire metadata tree. A
    mapping for ``id`` will apply to every field named ``id`` in every
    RecordSet. When a name resolves to more than one field, a warning is
    printed so the user can confirm the override is intended for all of
    them.

    User-supplied ``data_types`` are APPENDED to the inferred Croissant type
    rather than replacing it. The mlcroissant validator requires at least
    one Croissant dataType per field, and the 1.1 spec explicitly supports
    multiple types coexisting (e.g. ``["sc:URL", "wd:Q515"]``).

            name: Dataset name (defaults to directory name).
            description: Dataset description.
            url: Dataset URL.
            license: License URL or SPDX identifier (e.g. "CC-BY-4.0").
            citation: Citation text, preferably BibTeX format.
            version: Dataset version string.
            date_published: Publication date in ISO format ("2023-12-15" or
                "2023-12-15T10:30:00").
            date_created: Creation date in ISO format.

            same_as: URLs of equivalent dataset records (e.g. DOI, mirror landing
                pages). Multiple values supported per schema.org/sameAs.
            sd_license: License of the metadata description itself, distinct from

            sd_version: Version of the metadata description, distinct from
                ``version``. Defaults to None — only emitted when set.

            is_live_dataset: Mark dataset as a live, evolving stream.
            temporal_coverage: Time period the data covers — schema.org accepts

                extraction. None (default) auto-sizes from the CPU count; 1
                forces serial. Output is identical regardless of this value.

            excludes: Glob patterns to exclude. Applied after includes.
            rai_fields: Native mlcroissant RAI metadata fields, passed through
                to ``mlc.Metadata`` unchanged.
            handlers: Which handlers to consult, and in what order. Defaults to
                the built-in registry. Supply one to bake with a narrower set,
