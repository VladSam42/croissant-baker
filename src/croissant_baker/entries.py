"""The vocabulary of the scan stage: outcomes, reasons, and the per-file entry.

A leaf module. It imports nothing from the package, so any module that needs to
name an outcome or a reason can import it without pulling in the pipeline —
:mod:`croissant_baker.duplicates` and :mod:`croissant_baker.report` both do.

Entries are mutated in place by the extraction stage, one thread per entry, and
read back in scan order, so output does not depend on how many workers ran.
